1.1: Hardware, Software and Computer Types
==========================================
This section will take a look at hardware/software and the different types of computers.

You will learn the differences between hardware and software, as well as examples of each.

You will also see different types of computers including their uses, advantages and disadvantages.

Hardware
^^^^^^^^
**Definition:** *"All the physical parts of a computer that you you can see, touch and pick up."*

Overview of hardware:
"""""""""""""""""""""
#. Hardware is 'physical'. Physical means that it can be touched and picked up.
#. Hardware works with computer code to carry out jobs such as:

   #. Producing an image on a computer screen
   #. Producing sound
   #. Moving cursers / pointers around a screen
   #. etc

Examples of hardware:
"""""""""""""""""""""
* Keyboard
* Mouse
* Monitor
* Scanner
* Printer
* CD-ROM
* Motherboard
* Digital Camera
* Speakers
* Web Cam
* RAM
* Hard Disk
* Processor
* Microphone
* Memory Stick

Other examples of hardware include: Graphics Card, Sound Card, Network Card, Computer Case, Cooling Fan, Modem, Router, CD/DVD Reader, CD/DVD Burner, Power Supply, Cables.

Software
^^^^^^^^
**Definition:** *"Coded programs that control how the computer works"*

#. Software cannot be touched or picked up. This is because software is not physical. It exists as computer code inside the computer.
#. There are 2 types of software - System Software and Application Software.
#. It refers to the programs that we run on our computer and it tells the hardware how to do something useful. Software is basically a set of instructions (written in computer code) that tells the hardware what to do
#. Without software, most hardware would be useless. 

Examples of software:
"""""""""""""""""""""
**System software:** *This type of software includes operating systems and different utilities to allow your system to run smoothly. System software often manages the computer's resources.*

* Operating Systems
* Disk Cleaners
* Disk Defragmenter
* Virus Protection

Other examples of system software include: Graphic Drivers, Debuggers to identify system errors, Compression Software, Encryption Software, Disk Check

**Application software:** *Everyday programs that you use to produce something useful. Microsoft Word and PowerPoint are good examples.*

* Word Processors
* Graphics Editors
* Web Design Programs
* Spreadsheet Programs
	  	
Other examples of application software include: Presentation Program (PowerPoint), Database Program (Access), Web Browser (Internet Explorer), CAD Design Software, Media players, Computer Games
.. warning:: **Note:** If you are asked to name types of software you should NOT use brand names. For example, you should use 'Graphics Editor' rather than 'Adobe Photoshop'.

Types of Computers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Definition:** *"Computers are devices that accept information and then manipulate it to produce a result."*

Computers allow us to perform many different tasks from gaming to complicated calculations. Computers range from very large to very small and it is estimated that there are over 1 billion of them in use around the world.

There are many different types of computers and people often choose which type they use based on what sort of tasks they want the computer to carry out. This section covers the main types of computers.

Personal Computer (Desktop PC)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* Personal Computers are usually found in the home.
* They are designed to be used by one person at a time and perform tasks such as school work, gaming, household accounts, internet access and emailing.
* Personal Computers are made up of input devices, output devices and storage devices all held together within a base unit which houses all the hardware components that make the PC work.

Laptop
""""""
* Laptops are portable computers and are small enough to sit on your lap.
* They can be used almost anywhere due to their small size and a built-in battery which powers the laptop when there is no access to a plug socket.
* Modern laptops are generally almost as powerful as a Desktop PC and are used for similar tasks and purposes.
* They have LCD screens (Liquid Crystal Display) which use low-power. This helps increase the run-time of a laptop's battery.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Advantages (compared to PC's)                                                                                                     | Disadvantages (compared to PC's)                                    |
+===================================================================================================================================+=====================================================================+
| Smaller and lighter and are much easier to transport. (portable)                                                                  | Limited battery life means you need to recharge quite frequently.   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Laptop components use low-power.                                                                                                  | Smaller keyboards are sometimes hard to use.                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Built-in rechargeable battery means they will work even without a mains power supply. (portable)                                  | Laptops are prone to theft as they are often used in public places. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Usually come with built-in Wi-Fi which means they can access the internet from locations with access.                             | Laptops are compact and can get hotter than a desktop PC.           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+                                                                     +
| No need to transfer files onto portable storage if you need to work in a different location. You simply take the laptop with you. |                                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
Mainframes
""""""""""
* Mainframes are very large and expensive and are capable of supporting hundreds, or even thousands, of users at the same time.
* They are used in large organisations for processing huge amounts of data or to control massive networks of computers.
* Mainframes use more than one processor (parallel processing) which means they can process many jobs at the same time.
* Early mainframes were the size of a room and got their name because they were housed in large metal ‘frames’.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Advantages (compared to other computers)                               | Disadvantages (compared to other computers)                           |
+========================================================================+=======================================================================+
| They can process huge amounts of data very quickly.                    | Very expensive to buy (and to run).                                   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Can perform millions and millions of calculations per second.          | They are very large and so are almost impossible to transport.        |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Parallel processing means they can handle many tasks at the same time. | They generate a lot of heat and need to be in air-conditioned rooms.  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| They can run and manage huge networks of computers.                    | They need a high-level of training for people to be able to use them. |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
Netbook
"""""""
* Netbooks are extremely small and light versions of laptops and typically weigh about 6 pounds.
* Netbooks can be used for similar tasks to a laptop but they are not as powerful and have much smaller screens.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Longer battery life (their low-power components require less energy).            | Low performance means they are not suitable for power-hungry tasks like video editing. |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Cheaper because they do not come with certain components (such as CD/DVD drive). | Small screen make images and text difficult to see.                                    |
+                                                                                  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
PDA (personal digital assistant)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* PDA’s are handheld computers with facilities including:

  * Personal organiser (birthdays, appointments etc)
  * Internet browsing
  * Telephone calls
  * Multimedia (video, music etc)
  * etc

* Generally speaking, there is very little difference between a PDA and a modern mobile phone.

Palmtop
"""""""
.. warning:: This information is likely to be out of date and useless for the new exam spec

* Palmtop's are very similar in computing power to PDA’s and are used for basic functions such as:

  * Calendars
  * Phone number and address book lists
  * Internet access
  * Email

* Palmtop's get their name simply because they are designed to sit in the palm of your hand. They often come with a small keyboard.
