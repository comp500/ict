1.1: Hardware, Software and Computer Types
------------------------------------------
This section will take a look at hardware/software and the different types of computers.

You will learn the differences between hardware and software, as well as examples of each.

You will also see different types of computers including their uses, advantages and disadvantages.

Hardware
^^^^^^^^
**Definition:** *"All the physical parts of a computer that you you can see, touch and pick up."*

Overview of hardware:
"""""""""""""""""""""
#. Hardware is 'physical'. Physical means that it can be touched and picked up.
#. Hardware works with computer code to carry out jobs such as:

   #. Producing an image on a computer screen
   #. Producing sound
   #. Moving cursers / pointers around a screen
   #. etc

Examples of hardware:
"""""""""""""""""""""
* Keyboard
* Mouse
* Monitor
* Scanner
* Printer
* CD-ROM
* Motherboard
* Digital Camera
* Speakers
* Web Cam
* RAM
* Hard Disk
* Processor
* Microphone
* Memory Stick

Other examples of hardware include: Graphics Card, Sound Card, Network Card, Computer Case, Cooling Fan, Modem, Router, CD/DVD Reader, CD/DVD Burner, Power Supply, Cables.

Software
^^^^^^^^
**Definition:** *"Coded programs that control how the computer works"*

#. Software cannot be touched or picked up. This is because software is not physical. It exists as computer code inside the computer.
#. There are 2 types of software - System Software and Application Software.
#. It refers to the programs that we run on our computer and it tells the hardware how to do something useful. Software is basically a set of instructions (written in computer code) that tells the hardware what to do
#. Without software, most hardware would be useless. 

Examples of software:
"""""""""""""""""""""
**System software:** *This type of software includes operating systems and different utilities to allow your system to run smoothly. System software often manages the computer's resources.*

* Operating Systems
* Disk Cleaners
* Disk Defragmenter
* Virus Protection

Other examples of system software include: Graphic Drivers, Debuggers to identify system errors, Compression Software, Encryption Software, Disk Check

**Application software:** *Everyday programs that you use to produce something useful. Microsoft Word and PowerPoint are good examples.*

* Word Processors
* Graphics Editors
* Web Design Programs
* Spreadsheet Programs
	  	
Other examples of application software include: Presentation Program (PowerPoint), Database Program (Access), Web Browser (Internet Explorer), CAD Design Software, Media players, Computer Games
