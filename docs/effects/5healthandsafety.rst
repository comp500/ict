There are a number of safety hazards linked with using computers and ICT devices.

This section looks into some of these potential hazards and what you can do to prevent them.

We will also look at some of the medical conditions and health problems that prolonged use of ICT devices can cause and what you can do to avoid them.

Health problems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are a number of health problems that you can suffer if you use ICT devices incorrectly or for too long. The main ones are: 

* Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)
* Back and Neck Strain
* Eye Strain and Headaches

1: Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
RSI causes painful swelling of the wrist and fingers. Sufferers with really bad RSI are unable to use their hands at all. 

RSI is caused by doing the same small movements over and over again across a long period of time. For example, clicking a mouse button repeatedly. 

Computer users who type and use a mouse all day long are commonly affected.

2: Back and Neck Problems
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
Back ache and neck ache can cause great pain and really affect the quality of your life.

Both back and neck ache can be caused by sitting incorrectly and using poor quality chairs without back rests. This is called poor posture (see below).

3: Eye Strain and Headaches

Staring at a computer screen for too long can strain your eyes and cause headaches.

Eye strain can cause your vision to blur.

Common causes of eye strain are screen flicker and having direct light causing screen glare (click links for video examples).
