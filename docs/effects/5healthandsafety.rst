There are a number of safety hazards linked with using computers and ICT devices.

This section looks into some of these potential hazards and what you can do to prevent them.

Health problems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are a number of health problems that you can suffer if you use ICT devices incorrectly or for too long. The main ones are: 

* Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)
* Back and Neck Strain
* Eye Strain and Headaches

1: Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
RSI causes painful swelling of the wrist and fingers. Sufferers with really bad RSI are unable to use their hands at all. 

RSI is caused by doing the same small movements over and over again across a long period of time. For example, clicking a mouse button repeatedly. 

Computer users who type and use a mouse all day long are commonly affected.
